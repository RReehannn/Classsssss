 Benefits of lambda

   Reduces the lines of Code.
   Sequential and Parallel execution support by passing behaviour as an argument in methods.
   To Call APIs very effectively
   To Write more Readable , Maintainable and Concise code

 Important Rules of Lambda

   if the body of Lambda Expression only one statement contain one statement then curly braces are optional
   java Compiler also inter the type of Variable passed in arguments, hence type is optional


   Functional Interface

   If the interface contains only one abstract methods then it is Functional Interface.
   EX: Runnable, Callable, Comparable etc.

  To call Lambda we required functional Interface.

   Lambda is used to implement functional interface in very simple and short manner.

    // functional Interface have only one abstract method.

    /*   How to use @FunctionalInterface

    1. For using functional Interface we have to create separate class and implements this interface.
    2. Anonymous class for implementing interface
    3. Lambda expression
